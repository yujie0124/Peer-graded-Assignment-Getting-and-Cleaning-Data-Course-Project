###Code Book
This is the code book for tidy data set.

###The original data was transformed by
-Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set.
-Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
-Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
-Appropriately labeling the data set with descriptive activity names.
-Creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

###About variables:
-x_train, y_train, x_test, y_test, subject_train and subject_test contain the data from the downloaded files.
-x_data, y_data and subject_data merge the previous datasets to further analysis.
-features contains the correct names for the x_data dataset, which are applied to the column names stored in
